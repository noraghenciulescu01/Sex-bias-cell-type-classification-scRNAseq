## Reproducing the classification experiment
The classification scripts are given only for the task where the proportion of female cells in the training set is 0. For other proportions, change the prop parameter in line 36: <br>

prop = 0 <br>

Change this to the desired proportion out of: 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1 and run as a separate job. The rest of the file should remain the same. <br>
